# repercussions-llm-2020
This is an essay I wrote back in early 2022 on the effects of large language models for my Ethics class.

The ideas and contents were largely informed by my predictions in 2020-21 when I was volunteering with the Trustworthy AI working group of Mozilla with Dr. and Marsha Courneya of Manchester Metropolitan University.

This is actually a toned down version ... becasue grades. My predictions were quite radical back then.
