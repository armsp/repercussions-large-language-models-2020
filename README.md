# repercussions-large-language-models-2020

Well suddenly in the past couple of months all newsoutlets and journalists are speaking about the death of college essay and things like that. Literally everyone. All at once. I had predicted this quite clearly back in 2020-21. I wish I had made my ideas public or written about them long ago. I don't these ideas are new...I am sure someone across the pond had the same ideas even before I did.

This is an essay I wrote back in early 2022 on the effects of large language models for my Ethics class.

The ideas and contents were largely informed by my predictions in 2020-21 when I was volunteering with the Trustworthy AI working group of Mozilla with Dr. David Jackson and Marsha Courneya of Manchester Metropolitan University. You can see our work here - https://algowritten.org/introduction-to-algowritten-i/ and the story collection here - https://algowritten.org/algowritten-i-the-mozfest-short-story-collection/

This essay is actually a toned down version ... becasue grades. My predictions were quite radical back then. Following is the text of the PDF.
